+ where should i start
- Maybe you could try talking to oceanographers.
^ They'll probably be interested!

+ what are we solving today
- Well, I finally met with the tipster who told us about chemicals being dumped into the Awakataka Strait...
^ turns out he has a lot of evidence!
^ We're looking for barrels that look something like this:
^ <call>require_img barrels</call>
^ Try not to let too many people know what we're doing!
^ We don't know who's behind this...
^ so we can't trust anybody!

+ will we be working together
- Not this time.
^ I have to track down some leads of my own.
^ But I'm sure you'll do a great job!

+ * barrels are contaminating *
- Makes sense. Any other information?

+ * whales that the news *
- Ahh. You're really smart, Ace!
^ Here's something.
^ I was following one of my leads, and it led me to an office.
^ The place was a total wreck!
^ All I could find was this one coded message:
^ **<call>userFunc getMessage</call>**
^ I have no idea what it means, but it might have been encoded using the code on my old Creature Cards.
^ I gave those out to lots of different people over the years, but maybe you'll stumble across them during your search.

+ its getting late i should go
- See you tomorrow!
