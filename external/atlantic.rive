+ where should i start
- Maybe you could try talking to oceanographers.
^ They'll probably be interested!

+ what are we solving today
- Well, I finally met with the tipster who told us about chemicals being dumped into the Awakataka Strait...
^ turns out he has a lot of evidence!
^ We're looking for barrels that look something like this:
^ <call>require_img barrels</call>

^ I have to track down some leads of my own.
^ But I'm sure you'll do a great job!
